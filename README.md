- [Eclipse shadow bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_band) are a phenomenon that occurs immediately before and after a solar eclipse.
- The phenomenon presents itself as subtle fast moving bands on the ground due to scintillation from atmospheric air turbulence.
- While visible to the eye, shadow bands are challenging to record due to their low intensity.
- The tool here provides code for extracting eclipse shadow band features from raw recorded videos. 
- See the following [Eclipse Shadow Band Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flDfQsxXi4E) video.
